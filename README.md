# digiCamControl_Bookscanning_Script
Automatically control multiple digital cameras when digitizing photo albums with digiCamControl

The script will automatically trigger multiple cameras in a set order with set time delays. To enable you to sit back and turn pages of a book whilst the software does all the hard work for you! The script will print out information as it captures pages or waits for you to turn a a page. I know digiCamControl already has a timelapse feature for multiple camera controls, but I found this to be much more adjustable and was able to easily change th order of multiple cameras.
