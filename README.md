# digiCamControl_Bookscanning_Script
Automatically control multiple digital cameras when digitizing photo albums with `digiCamControl`

The script will automatically trigger multiple cameras in a set order with set time delays. To enable you to sit back and turn pages of a book whilst the software does all the hard work for you! The script will print out information as it captures pages or waits for you to turn a a page. I know digiCamControl already has a timelapse feature for multiple camera controls, but I found this to be much more adjustable and was able to easily change the order multiple cameras shot in. 

# How to use 
 - Step 1 download [the script](https://github.com/Shellywell123/digiCamControl_Book_Scanning_Script/commit/e733972e3b5e0531d915fe7ecc8245e4534ea0c8)

 Note you can click `stop` at any time to stop the script from running
